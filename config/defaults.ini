#
# url - The remote URL to install flatpaks from
# deploy_url (optional) - The URL to change the remote to for
#   deployment. Primarily this is for Endless repos where we want to
#   install from a dev repo but configure the image to pull from the
#   prod repo.
# apps - List of Flatpak apps required for installation.
# runtimes - List of Flatpak runtimes required for installation.
# nosplit_apps - List of Flatpak apps pruned from split images.
# nosplit_runtimes - List of Flatpak runtimes pruned from split images.
# title (optional) - A title for the remote.
# default_branch (optional) - The default branch to use for installs.
#   This affects installs during the image build as well as at runtime.
#   Flatpaks that do not specify a branch will use this by default.
#
# Additionally, a URL or path for a flatpakrepo file can be specified in
# the repo_file option. The Url, Title, DefaultBranch and GPGKey keys
# are supported within that file. See flatpak-flatpakrepo(5) for
# details. This is also the only way that a remote-specific GPG key (not
# needed for Endless repos) can be specified. Note that the above config
# options take precedence over associated keys in the flatpakrepo file.
#
# The apps, runtimes, nosplit_apps and nosplit_runtimes options are all
# merged, so they support the typical _add_/_del_ scheme. For instance,
# apps_add_default and runtimes_del_product.
